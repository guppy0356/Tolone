// Copy MSW's worker script into every playground listed in the root package.json.
//
// MSW ships this as a postinstall of its own, keyed off `msw.workerDirectory` in the
// package.json at INIT_CWD. pnpm does not give dependency lifecycle scripts an INIT_CWD,
// so that hook throws on `path.resolve(undefined, ...)` and MSW's own catch discards it —
// silently, which is how thirteen playgrounds drifted without anyone noticing. Running the
// copy from the root project's own postinstall does not depend on INIT_CWD at all.
